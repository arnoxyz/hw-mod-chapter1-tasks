**Points:** - ` | ` **Keywords:** behavioral modeling, testbench

Implement a behavioral model of a full adder.
Below you can find a circuit schematic of such a circuit.

You are already provided with a file for your implementation in [fa.vhd](src/fa.vhd).
**Only use this file for your implementation**.

## Testbench

After you implemented your full adder it is time to test it.
We already provide you with a testbench skeleton file for that purpose at [fa_tb.vhd](tb/fa_tb.vhd).
Do so by writing a testbench that exhaustively applies all possible input values.
Use the waveform viewer of QuestaSim to view the signal traces and check if they are correct.
